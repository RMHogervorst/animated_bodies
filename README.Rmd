# Why

I noticed the cool [gganatomogram package](https://github.com/jespermaag/gganatogram) and I wanted to play with gganimate.
this combined looked like animations where you're drinking something and
it flows through your body. That is awesome!
Now let's see if we can make that work.

There must be serious problems that this package solves, but I'm here to play.
